*Back to PHP after long 10 years*

Initial commit for Silex implemantation of todo-mvc server.

Silex is PHP microframework based on Symfony (http://silex.sensiolabs.org/). This sample implements basic REST API
on the top of MongoDB. Several things still needs coming:
 * Git submodule for assets and HTML (split index.php from index.htm into separate folders)
 * Tests (PHPUnit)
 * Run it with normal server (Apache) not only internal PHP 5.4.x
