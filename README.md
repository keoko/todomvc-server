# TodoMVC Server

A collection of server side implementations compatible with TodoMVC
Backbone.  Plenty of work to do, plenty of changes to make.

[Current Spec and Rules etc.](https://github.com/kouphax/todomvc-server/wiki/App-Specification)

# Contribute

Please do.  I need to define a set of rules for this and a bunch of infrastructure for
testing new apps (Heroku app that pings endpoints and asserts results etc.) and some
thought around the rules and also how we generate a site to browser submissions (YAML file per submission)
